      Quartz job is a class that performs a task through implementing <code>Quartz.IJob </code>interface.  Its only method, <code>Execute </code>is called by the scheduler passing <code>JobExecutionContext </code>as the parameter. <code>JobExecutionContext </code>provides the job class with runtime environment of the Quartz as well as the job details. <code>JobDetail </code>serves as the definition for a job instance and it should be registered with the scheduler. <code>JobDataMap </code>is used for passing configuration information to the Job.

      Quartz Job contains the logic for performing the task but does not have information about when it should be executed. This knowledge is left for the trigger. There is three specialized triggers in the Quartz library.
